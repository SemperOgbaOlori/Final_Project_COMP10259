	<h1>About clownfish</h1><br>
	<p>
		The ocellaris clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris), also known as the false percula clownfish or common clownfish, is a type of marine fish in the Pomacentridae family, which also includes clownfishes and damselfishes. Amphiprion ocellaris can be found in a variety of colours depending on where it is found. Black Amphiprion ocellaris with white bands, for example, can be found near northern Australia, Southeast Asia, and Japan. Amphiprion ocellaris can also be orange or red-brown, with three similar white bands on the body and head. <br><br>
		
		The number of pectoral rays and dorsal spines distinguishes Amphiprion ocellaris from other Amphiprion species. Amphiprion ocellaris can reach a length of 110 mm. Females, like many other fish species, are larger than males. The life cycle of Amphiprion ocellaris differs depending on whether it lives on the ocean's surface or at the bottom. They live near the surface when they first hatch. When Amphiprion ocellaris enters the juvenile stage of life, they travel to the bottom of the ocean to find shelter in a host anemone. They form a symbiotic relationship with their anemone once they find it. 
	</p><br>
	<h1>Appearence</h1><br>
	<p>
		The common clownfish is a small fish that can grow to be 11 cm long (4.3 inches). It has a stocky build and an oval shape. It has a round profile and is compressed laterally. Its body colour ranges from orange to reddish-brown, but it can also be black in some areas, such as Australia's Northern Territory. It has three vertical white stripes that are bordered by a fine black line. The first goes just behind the eye, the second goes through the middle of the body and widens forward to the head in the centre, and the third goes around the caudal peduncle. A fine black line is also used to outline all of the fins. A. ocellaris is frequently confused with Amphiprion percula, which appears to have the same colours and patterns as A. ocellaris but differs by the thickness of the black outlines. A. ocellaris also has a taller dorsal fin and 11 dorsal-fin spines compared to 10 spines in Amphiprion percula.

<section class="predators-section fade-in" id="predators">
	<h1>Predators</h1><br>
	<p>
		Piscivores are the predator of clownfish. This group is made up of many organisms that live in the ocean, including groupers, sharks, and barracudas. Two of the predators that prey on clownfish are Great White Sharks and Great Barracudas. Piscivores have evolved to catch their small prey that lives in anemones. Many members of this group sit and stalk their prey, have large eyes, and can swim quickly.
	</p><br>
	<h1>Food Habit</h1><br>
	<p>
		Because A. ocellaris feeds on plankton and algae, they are classified as omnivores. The hierarchy in A. ocellaris groups has an effect on feeding as well. Smaller, less dominant fish have less energy to forage for food because they face aggression from larger, more aggressive fish. As a result, they usually do not eat as much as the dominant fish do, not only because they have less energy, but also because they face more danger when they leave their anemone because they are smaller. In other words, larger fish typically travel further than smaller fish. A. ocellaris feeds primarily on algae, copepods, and zooplankton.

<!-- Reproduction Section Start -->
<section class="reproduction-section fade-in" id="reproduction">
	<h1>Reproduction</h1><br>
	<p>
		The reproductive habits of A. ocellaris are very similar to those of all anemonefish. They have monogamous mating systems and different levels of aggressiveness between males and females during the spawning process. Furthermore, there is a reproductive hierarchy based on age and sex.<br><br>
		There is little information available about A. ocellaris reproduction. However, similar behaviours have been observed in all anemone fishes. These fish have monogamous mating systems and are fiercely protective of their anemone. During spawning, males become more aggressive. Male behaviour changes to attract females, including biting, chasing, and fin extension. The male prepares the nest near the anemone before spawning. The female begins the spawning process after the male chases her to the nest. She lays eggs for one to two hours before leaving the nest to allow the male to fertilise the eggs. It takes about six to eight days for the eggs to hatch (this time period can be affected by the temperature of water). Males typically care for the eggs due to external fertilisation. They are also in charge of eating fungi-infected or infertile eggs and fanning the eggs. <br><br>
		All anemonefish are protandrous hermaphrodites, which means they start out as males and can change into females later in life. When males, females, and juveniles share the same anemone, they exhibit phenotypic plasticity. The female is the dominant and largest member of an anemonefish social group, followed by the dominant male, while other anemonefish are non-reproductive. <br><br>
		In one experiment, three juvenile anemonefish were placed in a tank and their behaviours were observed for a month. The researchers drew conclusions about the fish's social hierarchy based on dominance indicators such as aggressive or appeasing behaviors, tank occupation, and body mass increase. The dominant fish grew larger than the lower-ranking fish, indicating that the lower-ranking fish experienced growth suppression. Furthermore, differences in the levels of certain steroids in the fish suggested that lower-ranked individuals experienced reproductive suppression as well. <br><br>
		When a female anemonefish is removed from the anemone, the dominant male becomes the female, and the next-highest-ranked male moves up the dominance hierarchy to become the dominant male. Females control males through aggressive dominance behavior, preventing the formation of other females, and dominant males prevent juvenile males from mating.

	<h1>10 Fun Facts About Clownfish</h1><br>
	<ol>
		<li>There are approximately 30 species of clownfish known. </li>
		<li>Clownfish are found in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where they live in the warm waters of sheltered reefs and shallow seas. To stay warm during the winter, they will migrate to deeper water.</li>
		<li>Clownfish follow a strict hierarchy, with the most aggressive female at the top.</li>
		<li>Clownfish are all born male. When the dominant female dies, the dominant male becomes a female.</li>
		<li>Not all anemones are suitable for Clownfish. Only ten of the over 1,000 anemone species can coexist with clownfish. Even so, only certain clownfish and anemone pairs are compatible.</li>
		<li>Clownfish eat everything. They feed on dead anemone tentacles, anemone leftovers, plankton, mollusks, zooplankton, phytoplankton, small crustaceans, and various algae.</li>
		<li>Clownfish are poor swimmers. They spend most of their time hiding in anemones, and when they do venture out, their swimming patterns are erratic.</li>
		<li>Male clownfish make excellent fathers. They will clean the nest, guard the eggs, and prepare the nest for the female.</li>
		<li>Clownfish communicate by making popping and clicking noises.</li>
		<li>Clownfish swam onto the reef, attracting larger fish, and luring them back to the anemone. The larger fish will be stung and eaten by the anemone, leaving the remains for the clownfish.</li>
